# Detect-attack-type-using-ML-oversampling-GAN *SMOT

1. Overview:
Cyberattack detection relies on machine learning (ML) to analyze network traffic and identify malicious patterns. However, attack datasets are often imbalanced, meaning some attack types appear far less frequently than normal traffic, leading to poor classification performance.

2. Oversampling Techniques:
To address class imbalance, we use oversampling techniques like:

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):

Generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority-class data points.
Works well when data is linearly distributed.
GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks):

Uses deep learning to create realistic synthetic data.
Consists of a Generator (creates fake data) and a Discriminator (distinguishes real from fake).
More effective for complex, non-linear datasets.

3. Implementation Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset that is collection from 3-dataset 
### **CIC APT IIoT Dataset 2024**: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iiot-dataset-2024.html
### **CIC IoT-DIAD 2024 dataset**: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iot-diad-2024.html
### **CIC-BCCC-NRC TabularIoTAttack-2024**: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/tabular-iot-attack-2024.html

analyze Class Distribution: Identify if minority classes need balancing.
Apply Oversampling:
Use SMOTE for structured, low-dimensional data.
Use GAN for high-dimensional, complex data.
Train ML Models: Train classifiers like SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks on the balanced dataset.
Evaluate Performance: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure improved detection of rare attacks.
